**Selecting changes to be added to the Git-timeline (staging)**

The staging GitHub Desktop assumes you want to stage all files. These files will show up on the left side bar when you open GitHub Desktop. You can unselect some of them (unstaging them) by clicking on the *check*.

**Adding changes to the Git-timeline (committing)**

In the field that says `Summary(Required)`, write a short description of the changes you have made. This message is what is called the *Commit Message*. After you've done this, click the blue button `Commit to repository`.

**Adding changes to GitLab/GitHub (pushing)**

Now we need to add changes to GitHub/GitLab. This is called pushing to the remote repository. After committing,  click on `Push origin` in the top bar.
