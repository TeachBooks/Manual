# Edit (merge conflicts, staging, committing, pushing)

Suppose we are writing a new chapter, or are updating an existing chapter for our Jupyter Book. We've created a new branch on which we are going to make the changes.

**Edit files as ...**
`````````{tab-set}
````````{tab-item} ... user type 3 ... 

**... by directly adding changes on a single file to the Git-timeline (committing) in ...**

```````{tab-set}
``````{tab-item} ... GitLab

In GitLab, you can directly make changes in the files on the remote repository. You can make changes to the files already in the repository using the text editor but you can also upload new files!

1. Navigate to the repository you want to work in and make sure you're in the correct branch.

2. Create a new file by clicking on the plus button in the top bar. You can either create an entirely new file by clicking `New File` or if you already have created a file you can upload it by clicking `Upload File`.

```

3. In the new window, you can start typing your content. Give your file a name and make sure to use the markdown extension: `Chapter1.md`. Once you are done, commit the new file to the repository by clicking the blue button `Commit changes`.

4. In case you want to make changes to an existing file, navigate to the file in your remote repository. Then click the blue button called `Edit` and select the option `Edit single file`.

5. Make your changes in the text editor and when you are ready, commit your changes to the remote repository by clicking on the blue `Commit changes` button.

```

6. In case you added a new file, you also need to include it table of contents of your book! The table of contents is specified in a file called `toc.yml` and it is already included in your repository if you used the teachbooks template. You can edit it and commit the changes in the same manner as you did with markdown `file.md` files.

In GitHub, you can directly make changes in the files on the remote repository. You can make changes to the files already in the repository using the text editor but you can also upload new files!

1. Navigate to the repository you want to work in and make sure you're in the correct branch.

2. Create a new file by clicking on the button called `Add file` in the top bar. You can either create an entirely new file by clicking `Create new File` or if you already have created a file you can upload it by clicking `Upload files`.

````{tab-item} ... using 'VS Code in your browser'

Using this feature, you can open VS Code in your browser and edit the files in your repository. By doing this, you completely by-pass the need to open (and install) VS Code and GitHub Desktop on your laptop making it the optimal way to quickly fix something. You can make changes to the files already in the repository but you can also upload new files!

**Regularly obtain updates from colleagues from GitLab/GitHub (pulling)**

If you collaborate with colleagues on your branch, you can get the updates from your colleagues as well by pulling from GitLab/GitHub. This synchronizes the remote repository with your local repository on your machine. On the left side-bar click on the icon that looks like a branch. 

<figure align="center">
    <img src="figures/VSCode_Pull.PNG" alt="Example Image" width="400">
</figure>

By clicking on the 🔄 button, you will pull your colleages' changes.

**Solving potential incompatible changes (merging conflicts)**

When multiple people work on one chapter, it is possible that conflicts will arise if you and your colleagues have made incompatible changes in the same branch. In that case, when pulling from the remote repository, Git in VS Code will recognize conflicts and help you to solve potential incompatible changes (merging conflicts). Open the files that are marked as conflicitng. 

<figure align="center">
    <img src="figures/Conflicts2.PNG" alt="Example Image" width="650">
</figure>

The figure above shows the conflicts. If you look closely you can see that the last couple of words of the paragraph are different in the main branch than in the branch we were working in. There are a couple of options in the top bar: 

- `Accept Current Change` will keep the change in your branch
- `Accept Incoming Change` will keep the change from the main branch (the branch you are merging into your branch)
- `Accept Both Changes` will retain both paragraphs

Choose one of the options to resolve the merge conflict. You now have updated your work with work from your colleagues and resolved potential conlicts. You are now ready to continue working on the content.

**Make some further changes to a file in for example VS Code and save them**

**Regularly obtain updates from colleagues from GitLab/GitHub (pulling)**

If you collaborate with colleagues on your branch, you can get the updates from your colleagues as well by pulling from GitLab/GitHub. This synchronizes the remote repository with your local repository on your machine. Click on `Fetch` in the top bar. Then on the same place, click on 'Pull'.

In this case there are two conflicted files. GitHub Desktop is suggesting to resolve the changes in VS Code (in that case have a look at the section treating VS Code). By clicking on the small downwards arrow you can also solve the conflict directly in GitHub Desktop by choosing the branch of the file you want to keep.
