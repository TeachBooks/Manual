# Assign task to yourself (milestones, issues)

In a repository, team members can define Milestones and Issues. Milestones are used to track the overall progress of the project to make sure that deadlines are met. A milestone can group many issues, which are individual tasks that need to be finished in order to reach the milestone.

An issue is built up of the following attributes:
- the title, this should just be a quick description of the task 
- a label, to assign a category to the task such as: new content
- an assignee, the person who created the task can assign a team-member to the task or the task can remain without an assignee. Then whoever would like to pick up the task can assign it to themselves!
- a discussion section, here team-members can discuss any questions about the task
- a due date, in case the task is urgent or to keep track of deadlines

Every team member can create issues when they think of a task that would improve the book.

The follwing steps explain how to create a branch from a new issue. By doing this you can create most of the steps described in the section called [branching](branches.md). However, if you are unfamiliar with the term make sure to still read the section to understand the function.
```
After creating the issue, the description of the issue will automatically open. On the bottom left there is an option `create a branch` (in yellow) from this issue. This will create a new branch in the repositery which you can use to solve the issue.
