The introduction, structure of the book and formatting of contents is done by the Editors. Some chapters and pages have additional primary authors who are identified at the top of an individual page, as necessary. If an author is not listed on a particular page, it is by the Editors.

We anticipate that the content of this book will change continuously. Therefore, if you'd like to refer to a specific chapter, we recommend using the source code directly with the citation that refers to the GitHub repository and lists the date and name of the file.
