The introduction, structure of the book and formatting of contents is done by the Editors. Some chapters and pages have additional primary authors who are identified within the book either at the bottom of the first page in a chapter, or at the bottom of an individual page, as necessary. If an author is not listed on a particular page, it is by the Editors.

We anticipate that the content of this book will change significantly. Therefore, if you'd like to refer to a specific chapter, we recommend using the source code directly with the citation that refers to the GitHub repository and lists the date and name of the file. Although content will be added over time, chapter titles and URL's in this book are expected to remain relatively static. You can refer to individual chapters or pages within this book as:

> `<Primary Author>` (2024) `<Title of Chapter or Page>`. In TeachBook Team (Ed.), _TeachBooks Manual_. https://github.com/TeachBooks/manual (`./book/intro/` chapter, accessed `<date>`).

## How the book is made

This book is created using open source tools: it is a JupyterBook that is written using Markdown and Jupyter notebooks. Additional tooling is used from the [TeachBooks initiative](https://teachbooks.io/) to enhance the editing and reading experience. The files are stored on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/TeachBooks/manual).
