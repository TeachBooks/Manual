Now that you've been introduced to the basics of a Jupyter Book, let's start making one! To make it very ease, we make use of GitHub to store your files online and host your website.

## Create a GitHub account
To get started, you need a GitHub account (not counted within the 10 clicks ðŸ¤­): https://github.com/signup

## Use the template
Now, let's start making a book. Therefore, we've made a template on GitHub which covers most of the technical steps required to have your book online. How to start using the template is explained in the `README` of the template, which is shown on the homepage of the template: https://github.com/TeachBooks/template. Please follow the steps provided there. When you're done, come back here!

## Let's practice!
