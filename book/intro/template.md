Now that you've been introduced to the basics of a Jupyter Book, let's make one! The TeachBooks Team has put together a set of tools to make the book-creation process as smooth and automatic as possible. This page guides you through the process of creating a book, followed by a series of exercises that are designed to help you get used to the syntax and structure of a Jupyter Book, as well as the tools and essential workflows associated with the editing, checking and review processes.

## 1. Create a GitHub account
TeachBooks relies of freely available services from GitHub to store files online, carry out the book-building process and host your book as a website. All you need to get started is a GitHub account (not counted in the 10 clicks ðŸ¤­).

```{admonition} Task 1
:class: tip

If you don't already have one, create a GitHub account here by visiting [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup). 
```

## 2. Use the template---it's really just 10 clicks!
Now, let's make a book: we've made a template on GitHub which carries out _most_ of the technical steps required to create a book and put it online. Instructions for using the template are in the `README` of the TeachBooks Template repository on GitHub, which is by default visible on the repository homepage: [github.com/TeachBooks/template](https://github.com/TeachBooks/template).

```{admonition} Task 2
:class: tip

Go to the [TeachBooks Template repository on GitHub](https://github.com/TeachBooks/template) and follow the instructions to create your book. When finished, come back to this page.
```

## 3. Check out your book!
Shortly after you create a book it will be available online at `<your_username>.github.io/<book>`. 


```{admonition} Task 3
:class: tip

Go to the [TeachBooks Template repository on GitHub](https://github.com/TeachBooks/template) and follow the instructions to create your book. When finished, come back to this page.
```

## 4. Let's practice!
Getting used to the syntax of writing in a Jupyter Book can be a bit daunting at the start, not to mention becoming familiar with the various tools and workflows required. To help make the learning curve somewhat easier to travel, a number of exercises have been prepared for you as part of an introductory **workshop**. The exercises are designed such that no prior experience with any tools or programming is required, as long as you have read the preceding introductory pages.

```{admonition} Task 4
:class: tip

Work through the sections attached to this page (you can find them in the left sidebar).
```

```{tip}
If you find that the exercises are too easy for you, jump to the last page in this section, which summarizes all tasks and exercises that should be completed to fully understand how to create collaborate with TeachBooks.
