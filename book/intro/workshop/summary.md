- Identify the key jobs that make up the entire workflow
- Read the summary page and answer the H5p questions.

### Exercise 3: Metadata

- Use the GitHub browser interface to edit the `_config.yml` file.
- Visit the Actions page and watch the build process
- Open the job and see the command line output

### Exercise 4: Online Editor
