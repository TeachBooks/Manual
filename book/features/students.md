This chapter includes some TeachBooks features which aim to improve the way students can use TeachBooks. These tools are fully student-side, they don't influence the book website and the author doesn't have to setup anything. Nevertheless, the author could point the students to the availability of these tools and use it as part of the didactical approach. These tools could also be useful for other users.
