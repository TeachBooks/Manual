Sphinx extensions are plugins developed for the Sphinx documentation ecosystem (which Jupyter Book is built upon). They extend or modify Sphinxâ€™s capabilities and can be added to Jupyter Book for extra functionality. Since Sphinx extensions are not an integral part of jupyter-book, as opposed to original jupyter-book features, they must be installed and configured explicitly, for example in the `_config.yml` file.

At TeachBooks, we have many TA's working on developing cool and handy extensions to use in our books. Here's an overview:

- Download link replacer: Controls the download options of the chapters in your book.

- Image Inverter: Makes it possible to distinguish figures and graphs that shouldn't automatically be converted by the dark/light mode.

- Custom Launch Button: Allows you to add buttons to your book which you can use as quick access or settings options.

- JupyterBook Patches: Fixes an issue where drop down menus would still take up space after being minimized.

- TU Delft theme: Provides a simple solution to have a uniform theme across all the books created at Delft University of Technology that matches the TU Delft identity.

- Rich hover over tips: This TeachBooks Tippy extension utilizes Sphinx-tippy and makes it plug-and-play within a JupyterBook.
