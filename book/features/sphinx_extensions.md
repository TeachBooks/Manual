# Additional functionality

```{admonition} User types

This section is useful for user type 4-5.

This sections includes the features developed by TeachBooks which add functionality to the book. Most of them are implemented as sphinx extensions, which are plugins developed for the Sphinx documentation ecosystem (which Jupyter Book is built upon). They extend or modify Sphinxâ€™s capabilities. Since Sphinx extensions are not an integral part of jupyter-book, as opposed to original jupyter-book features, they must be installed and configured explicitly, for example in the `_config.yml` file.
