The following tools are created by TeachBooks to ease the process of making books. We acknowledge that making books is a difficult process; it requires advanced knowledge on CLI, python packages, html-files, data-storage and website hosting. The tools in this chapter are intended for those users who lack knowledge on these topics (which includes most of the TeachBooks' community members itself).
