# Overview

As TeachBooks, we collect a suite of existing open-source software so you don't have to! Some of the software is developed with our TA's to improve the learning experience of our students and ease the book-development process for our teachers. As the open-source software landscape changes rapidly, it is essential to keep in contact and share resources amongst ourselves to minimize maintenance and downtime for our book websites and focus on what really matters: teaching!

Since the list of TeachBook features is getting quite long, we have grouped them in categories:
- Original Jupyter Book and Sphinx features
- Easy editing process
- Additional functionality
- Book styling
- TeachBooks student-view features

Additionally, not all features are built using the same type of sourcecode. For transparency, tags will help differentiate between the different backgrounds of the features:
- {bdg-warning}`Javascript overlay`
- {bdg-success}`Chrome Extension`
- {bdg-white}`GitHub App and Javascript script`
- {bdg-secondary}`Python Package`
- {bdg-light}`GitHub Reusable Action`
- {bdg-light}`GitHub Template`
- {bdg-dark}`Git Workflow`
- {bdg-primary}`Sphinx Extension`
- {bdg-danger}`iframe`

Finally, the purpose, installation process and usage of each features is elaborated on in the respective sub-sections.
