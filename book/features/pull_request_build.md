# Build pull requests from forks

When writing a TeachBook it is useful to automatically build and view these changes online. This exactly why we designed and build the [deploy-book-workflow](../external/deploy-book-workflow/README.md) tool, which also allows for multiple versions of your book to exist at any time with customizable URL's. However, it doesn't cover all use cases. Luckily, Read the Docs is a free tool that can easily be used for this purpose. It also provides a very easy way to view differences between versions on each page!

Pull Requests are a key tool for allowing anyone with a GitHub account to make a contribution to your work by forking your repository, adding commits, then sending them back to your repository via a Pull Request. Unfortunately you are not able to automatically build the book based on proposed changes in a pull request from a fork of your repository, as this requires the deploy-book-workflow in the fork to have GitHub Actions enabled to show the proposed changes in the book. Furthermore, when proposing your contribution in a pull request, you'd have to manually refer to your own built book (e.g., with a hyperlink). This process can be made easier by using [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/?ref=readthedocs.org), as it can automatically build a book based on changes proposed in a pull request, and includes a link to the book directly in the pull request page.

Read the docs is not recommended for final versions of your book because of the advertisement in the free version. If you'd like to pay for it, it can replace the functionality of the [deploy-book-workflow](../external/deploy-book-workflow/README.md).

This workflow does not work if you have local sphinx extensions in your book (extensions in `book/_ext` like [](./apa.md)).

```{tip}
Once set up, this tool is only accessible via the Pull Request page for a repository in the 'Checks' part of the automated rule set box (illustrated below). This is different from our deploy-book-workflow, which is accessed  

A Read the Docs account and admin privelages for the repository are only needed set this up; all visitors to the pull request page will be able to view the book, including the differencing feature.
```

## Usage

After visiting the summary page of a pull request you will be able to see the following line (_make sure you click "show all checks" to see it!_):

![Read the docs in GitHub preview](./figures/readthedocs1.png)

Click 'Details' to see the logs of the build process.

Whenever the build is done, click 'Details' again to see the build book. Tip, click `d` or add `?readthedocs-diff=true` to the url to see the differences on the pages highlighted. Note that this differencing functionality is not perfect as it might indicate elements which are not changed intentionally.  It is known to have issues visualizing changes associated with buttons, LaTeX and figures.

### Example
As an example, Read the Docs is configured in this [example book](https://github.com/TeachBooks/Read-the-Docs-example-book). Fork it and open a pull request to test it's functionality.

There's an example [pull request](https://github.com/TeachBooks/Read-the-Docs-example-book/pull/1) with corresponding [built book on Read the Docs](https://read-the-docs-example-book--1.org.readthedocs.build/1/intro2.html?readthedocs-diff=true).

## Setting up

This tool is a specific automation rule that is enabled within the GitHub pull request ecosystem.

### Add configuration file to your repository

Add a file `.readthedocs.yaml` to the root of your repository, containing the following content:

```yaml
version: 2

build:
  os: ubuntu-24.04
  tools:
    python: "3.13"
  jobs:
    pre_build:
      - "jupyter-book config sphinx book/"

python:
  install:
    - requirements: requirements.txt
    - requirements: standard-imghdr

sphinx:
  builder: html
  fail_on_warning: true
  configuration: book/conf.py
  ```

You might need to add `standard-imghdr` to your `requirements.txt` file if the build fails when you've configured it in Read the Docs (if the error tells you `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'imghdr'`)

### Setup Read The Docs account

Setup an account at [app.readthedocs.org/accounts/login/](https://app.readthedocs.org/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/). We recommend using your GitHub account for authentication.

When authorizing Read the Docs for your GitHub account, you can also grant access by Read the Docs for an organization of which you are an owner, as well, which we also recommend.

### Authorize access to organization

When you didn't do so in the previous step, or you'd like to grant access at a later moment, you can grant/revoke access by Read the Docs to your organization by following these menu items in settings: [`personal GitHub Settings - Integrations - Applications - Authorized OAuth Apps - Read the Docs Community`](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/fae83c942bc1d89609e2).

### Add project in Read The Docs

On your [dashboard](https://app.readthedocs.org/dashboard/), add a new project. Find your GitHub repository (you might need to refresh your repositories if you've recently updated authorizations).

### Enable Pull Request build

In the setting of your newest project, enable build of pull request by selecting the option in `Building - Pull request builds - Build pull requests for this project`.

### Additional settings

The following settings are recommended:
- `Setup` - `Settings` - `URL versioning scheme` - `Multiple versions without translations (/<version>/<filename>)`, as translated books can be implemented with [](../external/Sphinx-launch-buttons/README.md)
- `Setup` - `Settings` - `Addons` - `Search` - disabled, as your books already contain a search function and the Read the Docs search functions requires [additional setup](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/intro/sphinx.html#configure-read-the-docs-search)
- `Setup` - `Settings` - `Addons` - `Link previews` - disabled, `Multiple versions without translations (/<version>/<filename>)`, as previews can be implemented with [](../external/teachbooks-sphinx-tippy/README.md)
- `Setup` - `Settings` - `Automation rules` - `Add rule`, to build all tagged versions of your book:
    - `Description`: 'Build all tags'
    - `Match`: `Custom Match`
    - `Custom match`: `.*`
    - `Version type`: `Tag`
    - `Action`: `Activate version`
