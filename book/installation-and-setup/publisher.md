# Publishing your book with a publisher
You can choose to publish your online book with a publisher. This could increase findability of your book, but may have versioning, copyright and licensing consequences

For TU Delft employees, you can decide to publish via TU Delft OPEN interactive textbooks. Publishing will give you a copyright check, ISBN or DOI number, and registration in several shared databases but limits the amount of changes you can make to your book: for substantial changes a new published version is needed with an updated copyright checks. Small changes like typos can always be made, which are processed in the published version every hour.
In case of editing a book for a course during that actual course and/or your book has limited value outside your course's content, we advise you only to publish an archived version of your book whenever the academic year is over.
