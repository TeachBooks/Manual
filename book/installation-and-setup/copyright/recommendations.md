# Recommendations

This page collects best bractices used by TeachBooks collaborators, along with explanations for why we do it that way. We try to present a standard way of referencing material and attributing authors clearly; however, this can vary widely based on your own content, book setup and discipline.

```{Note}
This page is focused primarily on file formats and open content relevant to Jupyer Books. That means content written primarily in _text files_ (e.g., .md, .ipynb, etc.) that are shared with an open license and used to create a website (e.g., HTML files).
```

The recommendations illustrate:

1. How you can set up your own book, and 
2. An efficient and consistent approach to transparently _include_ and _reference_ the content of other authors.

This is important not only to properly attribute content in your book, but it can also be a useful way for you as an author to remember which material you have used in your book and find or update it later if changes are needed.
