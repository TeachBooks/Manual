## A Note to the Wary

Are you thinking something like this?

> I've put a lot of work into my material, and I don't want people to take credit for it or use it without my knowledge. However, I do see the value of choosing a license, especially an open one. Maybe I will choose something like CC BY-NC-SA, which allows others to use my work but not for commercial purposes, and not allowing them to modify it. That way, I can still get credit for my work and others can use it for educational purposes.

This is a nice sentiment, but when it comes to books, we don't advise it. There are several reasons, most of which stem from the fact that the "ND" license prohibits derivative works: in other words, the material cannot be modified and must be used in its entirety. This is problematic for a few reasons:
- What if you have a wonderful page describing Topic X, but there are a few contextual phrases that are undesired, for example: "this is required reading for Tuesday, December 17, 2024 in CIEM1000." That would be distracting for your own students, but you can't remove it.
- What is the point of including a website together with another website? It's easier to just link to your material directly.
- What if someone only wants a small part of your book? They can't use it.
- What if someone else makes similar material and releases it under CC BY and you include it in your own book? That does not seem fair to not also provide them an opportunity to benefit from your work.
- Often someone creates a copy of your work and makes improvements. The Git system (e.g., forks, commits, pull requests, etc) make it very straightforward to also include these improvements back into your original work. This would not be possible if you did not allow for reuse in the first place!

## Example: Programming-Focused Educational Materials

For example, the [MUDE Team](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl) is working towards releasing the files associated with assignments under an open license. Since the majority of the content is written in a storytelling style in Jupyter notebooks, a CC BY license is probably the best choice if only one license is applied to a single file. However, if released in bulk it may be better to follow the advice of [Matt Hall](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2021/2/17/which-open-licence-should-i-choose):

> You have to be practical; maybe it depends on whether you consider your notebooks to be 'content' or 'source code'. I sometimes put at the bottom of a notebook something like **Open source content. Text is CC-BY, code is Apache 2.0** and I think this makes my intent clear.
