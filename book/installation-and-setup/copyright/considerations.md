## Copyright Considerations

Copyright law dictates how online book material can and should be created, maintained and shared. An author should understand a few key concepts, as well as best practices, in order to create a book that not only is a useful resource, but, also fairly reuses the work of others and, if provided with an open license, enables original content to also be reused.

First, let's review a few key concepts that are specific to online textbooks.

```{tip}
Here we only focus on aspects that are explicitly relevant to the creation and sharing of online books. Visit the [TU Delft website](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/support/copyright) for a more thorough explanation of these important concepts.
```

## Key Concepts

**1) Copyright**

The legal right of the content _owner_ to use, publish, distribute, share, and/or duplicate the work. Copyright is divided into legal and moral rights, depending on the material and circumstances under which it was created.




Note in previous page we used the phrase:

> how you would like others to (re)use the content in your book

specifially "content in your book" ... this is because you are likely not the copyright owner of a book that contains educational material developed while employed at a University, for example. 

## Implications for Online Books

### Books

If it is clearly a _book_ in that it is a digital version of a classical paper textbook.

You are the author and you are the copyright owner. You should definitely indicate that the book was created 

### Educational Material

```{warning}
The TeachBooks Team isn't really sure when the "line is crossed" from educational material to book. More specifically, when the copyright owner is you (the author) or the University (your employer).

Do you have a better answwer that this warning box? Let us know!
```

```{danger}
Most TeachBooks tools and books do not yet conform with the guidelines specified in this manual, including improper copyright notes, authorship and licensing information. In fact, some of the licenses may be changed in order to better align with other closely-related tools.

We expect to carry out this work in early 2025.
