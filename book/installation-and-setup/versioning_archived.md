# Keep source code and website of all versions

In case you'd like other to use your source code and you've different versions, it might be useful to have the source code of those versions somewhere too. Don't be afraid, git makes it very easy to make this possible.

Git allows you to go back in the git history to the source code of old versions. To make this as easy as possible for readers, use branches, tags and releases instead of having the readers scroll through a long list of (not alway very descriptive) commit descriptions. How to use tags and releases is described in [](./versioning_changelog.md)
