# Convert LaTeX to Markdown

A script is to convert LaTeX files to Markdown, for use in Jupyter Books, which has been used successfully on at least one book in the TU Delft OPEN library: [Introduction to particle and continuum mechanics, by Timon Idema](https://textbooks.open.tudelft.nl/textbooks/catalog/book/81). The author is able to convert nearly everything in this book automatically, with only a few manual adjustments needed (e.g., a special character and a figure caption).

Depending on the number of custom LaTeX commands used in your book, you may need to adjust the script to handle them.

Additional information about the script, along with the source code itself, is available at the following link on TU Delft GitLab: [gitlab.tudelft.nl/opentextbooks/latex-to-markdown-conversion](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/opentextbooks/latex-to-markdown-conversion).
